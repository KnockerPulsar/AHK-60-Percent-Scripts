# AHK-60-Percent-Scripts
 A repository that stores all the AHK scripts I use with my 60% keyboard.

| Capslock + Number Row (1 -> +)                                 | F1 -> F12                            |


## Why?
Using the FN key with any shortcut doesn't detect other keys, so FN+W+Shift only detects Arrow Up.
This caused some issues for shortcuts such as aforementioned shortcut to select a line up.

Another thing that might be confusing, The backtick button and the escape button are both one key with the backtick as the primary function in my keyboard, that's why you'll find a few shortcuts
using backtick instead of escape.

## Notes
This is just a software workaround to my shortcut issues. Some applications such as osu!
detect keypresses directly (or so I think), so they won't detect this.

Most keys with Capslock as a modifier will also support Ctrl/Shift/Alt or any combination
of them.
